# load-js

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/MiguelCastillo/load-js.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Promise based script loader for the browser using script tags.

This is a UMD module, so feel free to include it in your nodejs bundling pipeline or directly in the browser via script tags.

> Promise implementation needs to be polyfilled if environment does not already provide it.

# usage

## install

```
$ npm install load-js
```

## api

loadJS is a method that loads scripts concurrently using script tags. loadJS takes in a single or an array of items where the items can be just a url string, or a config object with options for configuring:

- `type`: defaults to `text/javascript`
- `async`: defaults to `false`
- `charset`: defaults to `utf-8`
- `id`: no default value
- `url`: required if no `text` is provided
- `text`: required if no `url` is provided
- `cache`: flag to determine if item with ID or URL is to be cached. defaults to `true`

> text and url are mutually exclusive and you must specify one. If you call loadJS with a string as a parameter that string will be treated as a url. If you specify both, then url will be used.

The `async` flag will enable the browsers ability load and execute scripts as soon as possible. This means that scripts are likely going to excute out of order. Because of the nondeterministic script execution nature of `async`, it is defaulted to false.

These options are described in detail [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script).

## examples

Let's just give a simple example where `load-js` is loaded via a script tag in you HTML

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

    <!-- Include load-js -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/load-js@1.2.0"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      /* load your stuff */
      loadJS(["https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.1.js", "https://unpkg.com/react@15.3.1/dist/react.min.js"])
        .then(function() {
          console.log("jQuery and react are loaded");
        });
    </script>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Another example configuring the script execution to be asynchonous

``` javascript
loadJS([{
  async: true,
  url: "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.1.js"
}, {
  async: true,
  url: "https://unpkg.com/react@15.3.1/dist/react.min.js"
}])
.then(() => {
  console.log("all done!");
});
```
